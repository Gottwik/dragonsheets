* [Intro to digits](https://github.com/Gottwik/dragonsheets/raw/master/bundles/basic_digits_1.pdf)

## How does it work
For each completed dragonsheet, the child gets a dragon coin:

These coins can be bought here: http://campaigncoins.com/red-dragon-inn-set-5-players/

Which can be exchanged for, say, 10 minutes of electronics time. I guess every family can make up their own rules.
